// Typical flow

// Open app, select dimensions, change an option etc -> this only changes "ui" in the store
// Layout, Options, Dimensions are controlled components, they just render what's in "ui"
// When update button is clicked, current selection is grabbed from "ui" and put in current on the appropriate format
// Then data is fetched from the backend and the visualization is created

// If you load an AO (analytical object) it will be stored in "visualization" and "current" -> the visualization is shown
// Change selection (updates "ui") and click update (updates "current") -> "visualization" and "current" are now different objects -> show unsaved state indicator

// When dx/ou in "itemsByDimension" change -> update "recommendedIds"
// Keeping recommended ids separated to avoid re-render of the full list, only updating the dots
